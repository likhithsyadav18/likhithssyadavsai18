'''
Write a program which takes an input sorted array and updates it so that all duplicates have been removed and
the remaining elements have been shifted left to fill the emptied indices.Return the number of valid elements.
Example:[2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 11, 11, 11, 13, 15] after deletion of duplicates gives [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15].So, number of
valid elements are 7.
